## Using This Repository

To start making use of this repository, do the following:  

* Download Xcode from the Mac App Store if you haven't already.  
  * (**NOTE:**  Apple also offers a separate Command Line Tools suite which one can install on demand and/or if they so choose.)  
* Open a new instance of Terminal and use it to run the following commands (this assumes you already have the relevant ones installed, of course:)  

```
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode
git clone https://github.com/RandomDSdevel/Xcode-Templates.git ./Templates
```

  Please note that Xcode will likely not register that you have created a set of user-specific templates for it to display when you start a new project if you do not clone this repository into a folder of the name specified here, as Xcode, as far as I know, relies on this file path to find users' custom templates.  

One last note I should probably leave is that I don't currently have _any_ idea how you, as an end user, might clone this repository _without **wiping out any templates you have previously set up.**_  There _may_ be a way, but, that being said, don't ask _me_ what it might be, as _I'm_ no Git expert by a _long_ shot.
